App-CPAN2Pkg
============

cpan2pkg is an application that aims at producing native linux packages
from cpan distributions.

Yes, i know of cpan2dist - i've even created the CPANPLUS::Dist::Mdv
backend for Mandriva. However, cpan2dist is "just" creating the package.

But creating a package is more than that:
    - checking if package is already provided by your linux distribution
    - installing the package on the local system
    - importing newly created package in the distribution build system
    - building & distributing the new package in the distribution
    - and this, taking the module prerequisites into account...
      recursively!

So, cpan2pkg is an application that does all that. It uses cpan2dist at
its heart to generate the package, but interacts with the distribution
infrastructure to really provide the new package to the final
distribution users.
